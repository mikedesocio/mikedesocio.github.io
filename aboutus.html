	<p>My name is Mike DeSocio, and I’m co-owner of Four Troy Properties along with my father, David.</p>
	<p>When I moved to Troy in 2017, it was a total leap of faith. I didn’t know a single person in the city (or all of upstate New York, for that matter), but I had a golden opportunity: a stellar first job after college. I would be working as a journalist at a respected newspaper, telling the story of what I would come to find is a truly incredible place.</p>
	<p>Coming from Boston, I moved to Troy hoping to find the vitality I love so much about urban spaces. Troy absolutely delivered, with its burgeoning arts, food and activism scenes. In my first apartment in the historic downtown, I felt like I was part of a vibrant community with so much to offer and so much room to grow. I used to brag that I didn’t touch my car on weekends – I would park outside my apartment in Troy on Friday and spend the next two days walking the streets, browsing at the farmer’s market, sipping coffee at a cafe, or finding a new book to read at Market Block.</p>
	<p>So while I moved here for one opportunity – a job: I soon came to discover another – a community I deeply identified with and wanted to be a part of.</p>

		<p>Owning property in Troy was my natural next step. </p>
	<p>By owner-occupying an investment property, I would be able to put down roots and contribute even more to this city. Growing up, my father and I were always working on one home improvement project or another. His experience in home ownership and renovation led him to become a realtor, which now allows him to help clients find and create their dream homes. </p>
	<p>With our collective experience in home ownership, investment properties, and renovations, we bring to bear all the skills necessary to be outstanding stewards of our property and all of its history.</p>
